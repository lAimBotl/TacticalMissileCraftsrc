# TacticalMissileCraft


A mod that will focus on "realistic" Missiles (well atleast with fuel stuff)

I plan on adding 3 types of missiles (may take a while though since I am still learning)

1: Anti tank sized missiles, would be used in a hand held rocket launcher, and small turrets.

2: tactical missiles, long range (but not very long range) anti base missiles, launched from a special structure, or a special turret.

3: ICBM A very long range (and larger) missile that can only be launched from a special launch structure.

All missiles will require fuel, solid or liquid, (small rockets have fuel built in) (obviously larger, more long range missiles will require more fuel)


WIP:It is no where near done.

(also I still suck at coding, and wow missiles are harder than I thought they would be lmao.)
